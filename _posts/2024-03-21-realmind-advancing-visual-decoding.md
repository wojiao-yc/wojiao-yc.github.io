## Introduction

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have long faced the challenge of decoding visual stimuli from neural recordings. While recent advances in EEG-based decoding have made progress in tasks like visual classification and reconstruction, they remain limited by unstable representation learning and lack of interpretability. This gap highlights the need for more efficient representation learning and effective language interaction in visual decoding tasks.

## The RealMind Framework

RealMind is a novel EEG-based framework designed to handle diverse downstream tasks through:

1. **Semantic and Geometric Consistency Learning**
   - Enhances feature representation
   - Improves alignment across tasks
   - Achieves better performance in traditional decoding tasks

2. **Vision-Language Integration**
   - First framework to achieve visual captioning from EEG data
   - Leverages pre-trained vision-language models
   - Enables zero-shot capabilities
