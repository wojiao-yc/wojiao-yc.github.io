## Research experiences

### Visual decoding and reconstruction via eeg embeddings with guided diffusion
*Sep 2024 -- Oct 2024*

This study presents a novel EEG-based visual reconstruction zero-shot framework for decoding human vision, overcoming the limitations of fMRI in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The framework incorporates a tailored brain encoder (Adaptive Thinking Mapper, ATM) and a two-stage multi-pipe EEG-to-image generation strategy, where EEG embeddings are aligned with high-level clip embeddings and refined into image priors using a diffusion model, followed by further refinement in a pre-trained diffusion model. Demonstrated on EEG & MEG data, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, retrieval, and reconstruction, offering portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution, making it suitable for a wide range of BCI applications.

### RealMind: Advancing Visual Decoding and Language Interaction via EEG Signals
*Aug 2024 -- Dec 2024*

RealMind is a novel EEG-based visual decoding framework that addresses the limitations of fMRI by leveraging multi-modal models to interpret semantic information efficiently. By integrating semantic and geometric consistency learning, RealMind enhances feature alignment, achieving 58.42% Top-5 accuracy in a 200-way retrieval task and a 26.59% BLEU-1 score in a 200-way visual captioning task, marking the first successful zero-shot visual captioning using EEG data. RealMind offers a robust, adaptable, and cost-effective alternative to fMRI-based methods, providing scalable solutions for EEG-based visual decoding in practical applications.

### FLORA: A Unified Generalist Model for Visual Brain Decoding via Multimodal Neural Embeddings
*Dec 2024 - present*

FLORA is an end-to-end generalist model that integrates cross-modal neural data from EEG, MEG, and fMRI to construct a unified neural representation for visual brain decoding. It addresses the challenge of jointly acquiring and processing heterogeneous neural signals, which has traditionally constrained decoding performance. By leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and specialized diffusion decoders, FLORA achieves superior results in tasks such as neural signal retrieval and visual stimulus reconstruction, outperforming single-modal approaches. Its unified encoding architecture captures complementary information across modalities, supporting multiple downstream applications.
